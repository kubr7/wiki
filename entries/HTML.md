HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. As the backbone of web pages, HTML provides the essential elements that define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia. Introduced in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML has evolved significantly, with the latest version, HTML5, incorporating new features for better multimedia support and improved semantic structure. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to annotate text, enabling web browsers to interpret and display content as intended. Its simplicity and versatility make HTML accessible to both novice and experienced developers, while its role in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript allows for the creation of dynamic, visually appealing, and interactive websites. As the standard markup language for web documents, HTML continues to be a crucial skill for anyone involved in web development.
