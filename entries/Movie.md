A movie, also known as a film or motion picture, is a form of visual art and entertainment that uses moving images and sound to tell stories or convey information. It typically involves a sequence of images, called frames, that create the illusion of continuous motion when displayed rapidly in succession. Movies are usually accompanied by soundtracks that include dialogue, music, and sound effects, enhancing the viewing experience.
