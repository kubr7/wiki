Django is a high-level Python web framework renowned for its ability to simplify and accelerate the development of secure and maintainable websites. Created by experienced developers, Django emphasizes reusability, rapid development, and the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle. It comes with a robust set of built-in features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), an intuitive admin interface, and comprehensive authentication mechanisms. Django's modularity allows developers to plug in various third-party packages, enhancing its functionality and versatility. By handling much of the complexity involved in web development, Django empowers developers to focus on writing their applications instead of reinventing the wheel.
