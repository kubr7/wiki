CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology in web development, crucial for enhancing the visual presentation and layout of HTML and XML documents. Introduced in the late 1990s, CSS separates content from presentation, allowing developers to style web pages with ease and flexibility. It works by applying styles such as colors, fonts, margins, and animations to HTML elements, ensuring consistency and aesthetics across a website. CSS enables responsive design, making web pages adaptable to different screen sizes and devices, from desktop computers to smartphones. With CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and libraries such as Sass and Less, developers can expedite styling tasks and maintain scalable, modular codebases. As web standards evolve, CSS continues to evolve with new features like CSS Grid and Flexbox, empowering developers to create sophisticated and user-friendly interfaces. In essence, CSS is instrumental in shaping the visual identity and user experience of modern websites, contributing to a seamless and engaging browsing experience.
